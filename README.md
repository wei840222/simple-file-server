## Usage

```
  -addr string
        address to listen
  -config string
        path to config file
  -document_root string
        path to document root directory
  -enable_auth
        enable authentication
  -enable_cors
        enable CORS header
  -file_naming_strategy string
        File naming strategy
  -max_upload_size int
        max upload size in bytes
  -read_only_tokens value
        comma separated list of read only tokens
  -read_timeout duration
        read timeout. zero or negative value means no timeout. can be suffixed by the time units 'ns', 'us' (or 'Âµs'), 'ms', 's', 'm', 'h' (e.g. '1s', '500ms'). If no suffix is provided, it is interpreted as seconds.
  -read_write_tokens value
        comma separated list of read write tokens
  -shutdown_timeout int
        graceful shutdown timeout in milliseconds
  -write_timeout duration
        write timeout. zero or negative value means no timeout. same format as read_timeout.
```

Configurations via the arguments take precedence over those came from the config file.

## Authentication

This server does not require authentication by default. Anyone who can access the server can get/upload files.

The server implements a simple authentication mechanism using tokens.

1. Configure the server to enable authentication: `"enable_auth": true` or `-enable_auth=true`.
2. Prepare tokens. Any string value is valid as a token.
3. Add them to the configuration. There are two keys in configuration: `read_only_tokens` and `read_write_tokens`.
   If authentication is enabled but no tokens provided, the server generates a read-only token and a read-write token on its starting up.
4. Request with the token. Add Authorization header with value `Bearer <TOKEN>` or `token=<TOKEN>` to the query parameter. Authorization header takes precedence.

| Token Type | Allowed Operations                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| read-only  | `GET`, `HEAD`                              |
| read-write | `POST`, `PUT` in addition to read-only ops |

Note that `OPTIONS` is always allowed without authentication.

Authentication is failed when:

- A request has no tokens.
- A request has a token but not registered to the server.
- A request has a token but not allowed to the requested operation.

In these cases, the server respond with `401 Unauthorized` with body like as: `{"ok": false, "error": "unauthorized"}`.

No one can request write operations if you configures the server with read-only tokens only.
As a result, the server operates like read-only mode.

## TLS

v1 has TLS support but I decided to omit it from v2.

Please consider using a reverse proxy like nginx.

## Timeouts

(Since v2.1.0)

There are 2 timeout configurations: read and write.
The terms "read" and "write" are from the server's perspective. From clients, they are "upload" (`POST`/`PUT`) and "download" (`GET`) respectively.

Read timeout (`-read_timeout`) is the maximum duration for the server reading the request.
Clients should finish sending request headers and the entire content within this timeout.
This is set to 15 seconds by default.

Write timeout (`-write_timeout`) is the maximum duration for the server writing the response.
Clients should finish downloading the content within this timeout.
This timeout is not set by default. Before v2.1.0, this is set to 15 seconds.

Please consider changing these timeout if:

- the server or the clients are in a low-bandwidth network.
- you are working with large files.

Note that a longer timeout will result in more connections being maintained.

## Testing

To run all tests, just run `go test` as usual:

```
$ go test ./...
```

This includes end-to-end tests. By default, the server with on-memory FileSystem is created and it starts listening on
the port chosen randomly. You can control this behavior by setting the environment variables.

If `TEST_WITH_REAL_FS=${PATH_TO_DOCUMENT_ROOT}` is set, the test server uses the real filesystem. Make sure the document
root directory contains no files; otherwise, some tests might be failed. The directory will not be cleaned after testing.

If `TEST_TARGET_ADDR-${HOST}:${PORT}` is set, the test program doesn't start a local test server and sends requests to
`http://${HOST}:${PORT}`. Note that the target server's document root should be cleared prior to testing.

This repository has `docker-compose.e2e.yml` to run the E2E test. To run tests using this:

```
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml run --rm test
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml down --rmi local --volumes
```
